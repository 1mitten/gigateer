# ADR-002: Next.js vs Alternatives for Web Application

**Date**: 2024-03-01  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

## Context

Gigateer needs a web application that provides:
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline usage
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO and performance
- Real-time search and filtering of gig data
- Mobile-responsive design
- API routes for data access
- Static generation for cacheable pages

The application will serve as both a user-facing website and an API provider for potential future mobile applications or third-party integrations.

## Decision

We will use **Next.js 14 with App Router** as the web framework for the following reasons:

- Full-stack React framework with built-in API routes
- Excellent PWA support with next-pwa plugin
- Superior developer experience with hot reloading and TypeScript support
- Built-in optimizations for performance (image optimization, code splitting, etc.)
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Deployment flexibility (Vercel, self-hosted, Docker)

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Next.js 14 with App Router (Chosen)

**Pros:**
- **PWA Support**: Excellent PWA capabilities with next-pwa plugin
- **Full-Stack**: Built-in API routes eliminate need for separate backend
- **Performance**: Built-in optimizations (Image component, automatic code splitting)
- **SEO**: Server-side rendering and static generation out of the box
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, TypeScript support, excellent debugging
- **Ecosystem**: Large community, extensive plugin ecosystem
- **Modern Architecture**: App Router provides better organization and performance
- **Deployment**: Easy deployment to Vercel, good self-hosting options

**Cons:**
- **Framework Lock-in**: Tied to React and Next.js patterns
- **Learning Curve**: App Router is relatively new with evolving best practices
- **Bundle Size**: Can produce larger bundles than minimal frameworks

### Option 2: Vite + React + PWA Plugin

**Pros:**
- **Fast Development**: Extremely fast hot module replacement
- **Lightweight**: Smaller bundle sizes, faster builds
- **Flexibility**: Less opinionated, more control over configuration
- **Modern Tooling**: Built on modern ES modules

**Cons:**
- **No SSR**: Would need additional setup for server-side rendering
- **No API Routes**: Requires separate backend service

## Detailed Analysis

### PWA Requirements Analysis

| Framework | PWA Support | Service Worker | Offline Support | App Install |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Next.js   | ✅ Excellent | next-pwa plugin | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Manifest |
| Vite+React| ✅ Good     | PWA plugin     | ⚠️ Manual    | ✅ Manifest |
| SvelteKit | ⚠️ Limited  | Manual setup   | ⚠️ Manual    | ⚠️ Manual   |
| Nuxt.js   | ✅ Good     | PWA module     | ✅ Built-in  | ✅ Manifest |
| Remix     | ⚠️ Limited  | Manual setup   | ⚠️ Manual    | ⚠️ Manual   |

### Performance Considerations

**Next.js Advantages:**
- Automatic code splitting at page and component level
- Built-in image optimization with next/image
- Automatic static optimization for pages without server-side dependencies
- Built-in CSS optimization and critical CSS inlining

**Bundle Size Analysis:**
While Next.js may have slightly larger initial bundles, the automatic code splitting ensures users only download what they need for each page.

### Developer Experience Factors

**Next.js Wins:**
- Zero-config TypeScript support
- Built-in ESLint configuration
- Excellent debugging experience with React DevTools
- Hot reloading that preserves component state
- Built-in development server with HTTPS support

## Implementation Strategy

### Next.js Configuration

```javascript
// next.config.js
const withPWA = require('next-pwa')({
  dest: 'public',
  register: true,
  skipWaiting: true,
  runtimeCaching: [
    {
      urlPattern: /^https?.*\.(png|jpg|jpeg|svg|gif)$/,
      handler: 'CacheFirst',
      options: {
        cacheName: 'images',
        expiration: {
          maxEntries: 64,
          maxAgeSeconds: 24 * 60 * 60 // 24 hours
        }
      }
    },
    {
      urlPattern: /^\/api\/gigs/,
      handler: 'NetworkFirst',
      options: {
        cacheName: 'api-cache',
        expiration: {
          maxEntries: 32,
          maxAgeSeconds: 5 * 60 // 5 minutes
        }
      }
    }
  ]
});

module.exports = withPWA({
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  images: {
    domains: ['example-venue.com', 'another-venue.com'],
  },
  experimental: {
    typedRoutes: true
  }
});
```

### App Router Structure

```
src/app/
├── layout.tsx              # Root layout with PWA setup
├── page.tsx                # Home page (gig listings)
├── gig/
│   └── [id]/
│       └── page.tsx        # Individual gig pages
├── api/
│   ├── gigs/
│   │   ├── route.ts        # GET /api/gigs
│   │   └── [id]/
│   │       └── route.ts    # GET /api/gigs/[id]
│   └── meta/
│       └── route.ts        # GET /api/meta
└── offline/
    └── page.tsx            # Offline fallback page
```

### PWA Features Implementation

1. **Service Worker**: Automatically generated by next-pwa
2. **Offline Support**: Cache API responses and static assets
3. **Background Sync**: Queue API updates when offline
4. **Push Notifications**: For new gig alerts (future feature)
5. **App Installation**: Web App Manifest for native-like installation

## Trade-offs and Mitigation

### Trade-offs Accepted

1. **Framework Lock-in**: Accepted due to the comprehensive feature set and ecosystem
2. **Bundle Size**: Mitigated through automatic code splitting and lazy loading
3. **Complexity**: The comprehensive feature set comes with some complexity, but it's well-documented

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Version Lock**: Pin to specific Next.js version to avoid breaking changes
2. **Escape Hatch**: If needed, can extract React components and API logic to other frameworks
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement performance monitoring to catch any issues early

## Success Metrics

We will evaluate this decision based on:

1. **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS scores
2. **PWA Audit Scores**: Lighthouse PWA audit results
3. **Developer Productivity**: Time to implement features, bug resolution time
4. **User Engagement**: PWA installation rates, offline usage patterns
5. **Build Performance**: Build times and deployment frequency

### Target Metrics
- Lighthouse Performance Score: >90
- PWA Audit Score: >90
- First Contentful Paint: <2s
- Time to Interactive: <3s
- PWA Installation Rate: >5% of users

## Future Considerations

### Potential Migration Scenarios

1. **React Server Components**: Next.js is leading in RSC adoption
2. **Edge Computing**: Next.js has excellent edge deployment support
3. **Mobile App**: React Native could share components with Next.js web app
4. **Micro-frontends**: Next.js can be configured for micro-frontend architectures

### Technology Evolution

- **App Router Maturity**: Continue monitoring App Router stability and best practices
- **PWA Standards**: Track evolving PWA capabilities and standards
- **Performance Optimizations**: Leverage new Next.js performance features as they're released
