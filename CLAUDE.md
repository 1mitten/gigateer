# CLAUDE.md - Quick Reference Guide

## 🚀 Core Principles

### 1. Think First, Act Second
- Analyze full scope → Identify parallel tasks → Plan execution order → Consider dependencies

### 2. DRY & Code Quality (MANDATORY)
- **Centralize config** in dedicated files (not scattered hardcoded values)
- **Extract patterns** into reusable components/utilities  
- **Single source of truth** for all data/logic
- **Type safety** with shared interfaces

### 3. Parallel Execution Strategy
Use multiple agents concurrently for independent tasks. Sequential only when dependencies exist.

## 🛠️ Project Commands

### Daily Development
```bash
# CRITICAL: Always build first
pnpm build                        # Must pass before any work!

# Start services  
pnpm dev                          # All development services
pnpm --filter web dev             # Just Next.js app

# Data ingestion (most common)
pnpm ingest:all                   # Run all scrapers
pnpm ingest:source <name>         # Run specific scraper  
pnpm merge                        # Create catalog.json
pnpm validate                     # Check data integrity

# Testing & Quality
pnpm test                         # Run all tests
pnpm lint                         # Lint all code
pnpm typecheck                    # TypeScript checking
```

### Before Task Completion (MANDATORY)
```bash
pnpm build && pnpm test          # Must pass both
```

### After Code Modifications (MANDATORY)
**ALWAYS verify tests pass after ANY code changes:**
```bash
# Run specific package tests during development
pnpm --filter <package-name> test    # Test specific package (runs once, exits)
pnpm --filter contracts test         # Example: contracts package
pnpm --filter ingestor test          # Example: ingestor service

# Full validation before commit/PR
pnpm test                            # All tests must pass (runs once, exits)

# Watch mode for active development (optional)
pnpm --filter web test:watch         # Vitest watch mode for web package
```

**Test Failure Protocol:**
1. **Never ignore failing tests** - Fix immediately
2. **Run tests after every significant change** - Don't batch fixes  
3. **Check all affected packages** - Changes to contracts affect everything
4. **Validate external dependencies** - Some tests may fail due to network/DB unavailability (expected)

## 📋 Code Quality Checklist

## 🔧 Configuration-Driven Scrapers

**Revolutionary achievement (Jan 2025)**: Add scrapers with JSON only - no TypeScript required!

### Quick Scraper Creation
```bash
# 1. Create JSON config in services/ingestor/data/scraper-configs/
cp exchange-bristol.json my-venue.json

# 2. Edit configuration (URL, selectors, mappings)

# 3. Test immediately  
pnpm ingest:source my-venue

# 4. Debug if needed (enable screenshots in config)
```

### 🎭 Playwright MCP Integration for Scraper Development

**Available for all agents**: Claude can now use Playwright MCP server for advanced web scraping and browser automation.

#### Key Capabilities
- **Live browser interaction** - Navigate, click, type, inspect elements in real-time
- **Visual debugging** - Take screenshots and snapshots to understand page structure  
- **Element discovery** - Find selectors by interacting with live pages
- **Dynamic content handling** - Wait for JS-rendered content, handle SPAs
- **Network monitoring** - Track API calls and resource loading

#### Scraper Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Use agent with Playwright to explore target website
# Agent navigates to site, takes snapshots, identifies selectors

# 2. Agent creates/updates JSON scraper config with discovered selectors
# Based on live page inspection and testing

# 3. Test scraper config immediately
pnpm ingest:source venue-name

# 4. Agent can debug failed scrapers by re-visiting pages with Playwright
# Visual inspection of changes, updated selectors, validation
```

#### Best Practices with Playwright
- **Visual-first approach**: Always take screenshots/snapshots before creating selectors
- **Test selectors live**: Verify selectors work on actual pages before saving to config
- **Handle dynamic content**: Use wait conditions for JS-heavy sites
- **Respect rate limits**: Use realistic delays between actions
- **Debug visually**: When scrapers fail, use Playwright to see what changed

### JSON vs Traditional Plugins
- **Configuration-driven (.json) + Playwright**: Modern, visual development with live testing ⚡
- **Traditional (.ts)**: Legacy approach for complex custom logic

## 📊 MongoDB Setup

### Quick Start
```bash
./scripts/setup-mongo.sh --quick-start      # Development setup
mongoimport --db gigateer --collection gigs --file ./data/catalog.json --jsonArray
```

### Modes
- **File-based** (default): Uses JSON files - good for development  
- **Database**: Uses MongoDB - better performance for production

## 🧪 Testing Strategy (MANDATORY)

### Test Commands
```bash
pnpm test                         # All tests across monorepo
pnpm --filter web test           # React component tests  
pnpm --filter ingestor test      # Business logic tests
pnpm test --coverage             # With coverage report
```

### 🎭 Playwright-Enhanced Testing
Use Playwright MCP for advanced scraper testing and validation:

```bash
# Example: Agent-driven scraper development
# 1. Agent uses Playwright to visit venue website
# 2. Agent takes snapshots and identifies selectors  
# 3. Agent creates JSON config with discovered selectors
# 4. Agent tests scraper: pnpm ingest:source new-venue
# 5. If issues found, agent re-visits with Playwright to debug
```

### ALWAYS Test For
- [ ] New components, functions, modules
- [ ] Bug fixes (test reproduces bug first)
- [ ] API endpoints & data processing
- [ ] Schema validation & transformation
- [ ] Error handling & edge cases
- [ ] **Scraper selectors** - Use Playwright to verify elements exist and data extracts correctly
- [ ] **Dynamic content** - Test with Playwright on JS-heavy sites to ensure proper waiting

### Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum**: 70% overall, 80% for new code
- **Critical paths**: 95%+ (auth, payment, data ingestion)

### Test Resilience Best Practices
**Our tests handle external dependencies gracefully:**
- **Network failures**: Tests skip gracefully when external services unavailable
- **Database connections**: MongoDB tests pass even when DB not running  
- **Timeouts**: All integration tests have appropriate timeout values
- **Error handling**: Tests catch and handle expected environmental failures

### Package-Specific Testing Notes
```bash
# Core packages (always test after changes)
pnpm --filter contracts test      # 31 tests - Zod schemas, utils
pnpm --filter dedupe test         # 130 tests - Deduplication logic  
pnpm --filter scraper test        # 80 tests - Scraping utilities
pnpm --filter ingestor test       # 32 tests - Data ingestion (may skip external deps)
pnpm --filter web test           # React component tests
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Failures
- **TypeScript errors**: Fix before proceeding
- **Import/export mismatches**: Check interface definitions
- **Node.js ESM issues**: Ensure `"type": "module"` in package.json

### Test Failures
- **Schema changes**: Update `contracts` package first, then affected packages
- **Missing fields**: Check if interfaces need new properties (e.g., `genre`, `price`)
- **Timeout errors**: Integration tests may timeout due to external services (expected)
- **Path resolution**: Tests change directory - verify CLI commands use correct paths
- **Jest config warnings**: Update deprecated `moduleNameMapping` to `moduleNameMapper`
- **Watch mode hanging**: Use `vitest run` instead of `vitest` for CI/automated testing

### React Issues  
- **Hooks order errors**: All hooks before conditional logic
- **Hydration issues**: Use client-only components with `dynamic`
- **Performance**: Memoize expensive calculations, prevent re-renders

### Data Loading
- **Initial loading issues**: Check SSR vs client-side rendering
- **API timeout**: Increase timeout values, add retry logic
- **Infinite scroll**: Verify React Query configuration

## 📝 Project-Specific Patterns

### Data Flow
```
External Sources → Scraper Plugins → Raw JSON → Validation → catalog.json → API → React UI
```

### File Structure
- **Configuration**: All in `/src/config/` files
- **Components**: Single responsibility, reusable patterns
- **Business Logic**: Separated from UI in custom hooks/services
- **Error Handling**: Centralized patterns with user-friendly messages

### Environment Types
- **Development**: Frequent scraping (10min), verbose logging, higher rate limits
- **Production**: Conservative scraping (3hr), minimal logging, respectful rate limits
