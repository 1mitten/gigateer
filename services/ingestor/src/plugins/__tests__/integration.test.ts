// Note: Legacy TypeScript scrapers were removed from codebase (html-playwright-scraper, rss-ical-scraper, venue-website-scraper)
// This test file needs to be updated to test modern configuration-driven scrapers instead
//
// The integration tests below were written for the old TypeScript-based scraper plugins
// that have been replaced by JSON configuration-driven scrapers.
//
// TODO: Update these tests to work with the new ConfigDrivenPluginLoader system
// or remove if no longer relevant.

  // If integration testing is needed, it should be implemented for the new
